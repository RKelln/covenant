## Reading Markdown Files

Use AGENTMAP.md first for search/discovery.
Flow: read AGENTMAP.md -> identify file -> read AGENT:NAV -> jump to section.

AGENT:NAV appears immediately after frontmatter.
Read the first 50 lines then use AGENT:NAV to target reads.

- If purpose does not match your task stop reading.
- Use s;n ranges: Read(offset=s; limit=n).
- If a description has `>` hints (e.g. `topic>sub1;sub2;sub3`); scan hints before reading the full parent section.

## Before Committing Markdown Changes

1. Run: agentmap update <changed files>
2. Review output for sections marked content-changed or new.
3. Read flagged sections and update their descriptions in the nav block.
    - Do not edit s;n counts; nav[N]; or see[N] by hand.
    - Update only purpose; about; and see descriptions.
    - Keep nav block format stable; add a `see` block after nav entries if needed.
4. Commit.
